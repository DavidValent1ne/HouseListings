# HouseListings
This simple webpage will allow users to use an interactive map to help them find houses in an area of their choosing. By clicking the marker on the map it will search for a house with the same longitude latitude as the marker.

Make sure to run this using a local server.

in cmd run
npm install -g http-server  
Make sure to cd to the same directory that the files are saved at.
http-server -c-1  
From here I just ran off of one of the available ports that became available.
